Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling

This solution for the "Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling" problem, is implemented in C++. The algorithm efficiently calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by scheduling non-overlapping jobs, each with a start time, end time, and associated profit. The approach involves creating a Data structure to hold job details, sorting jobs by their end times, and utilizing dynamic programming to compute the optimal profit. For each job, the solution uses binary search to find the last non-overlapping job, ensuring no conflicts. The dynamic programming array maintains the maximum profit up to each job, considering both the inclusion and exclusion of the current job's profit. This method effectively combines sorting, binary search, and dynamic programming, providing an efficient solution to the job scheduling problem. The example provided demonstrates the implementation with predefined job data and can be adapted for various use cases.
